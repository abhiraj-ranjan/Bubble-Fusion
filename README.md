# Bubble-Fusion
## A Match and Burst Puzzle
- An interactive puzzle game where players swap adjacent colored balls to form clusters of three or more.
- Successful clusters disappear, creating a cascading effect as balls above fall into empty spaces due to gravity.
- DFS-based cluster detection to identify and clear groups of connected balls.
